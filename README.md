# Project Name
> Linear Regression bike sharing assignment to model the demand for shared bikes for a US based bike sharing service provider. As a Data Science consultant, we are supposed to identify the key variables impacting the demand and give some inferences in order to drive the business strategy to increase the demand for these bikes and create an edge in the market.

## General Information
- This project is aimed at understanding the key variables that impact the demand for shared bikes in the US market so that the business can study the significant variables and try to tweak them in order to create and edge for the company in the market.


## Conclusions
- Our model to predict the demand for shared bikes is doing quite well with the given set of independent variables

- The temperature variable has the highest coefficient 0.4304, which means if the temperature rises by 1 unit, the number of bike rentals increases by 0.4304

- The Light Snow and the Mist+Cloudy variables have negative coefficients, which means a reduction in bike rentals

- The windspeed variable also has a negative coefficient, which means a reduction in bike rentals with increase in the windspeed

- Spring season has negative coefficients, so the company can run some discount offers to attract the customers to book more

- Sunday is seeing a drop in bookings so the company can run some promotional events in and around parks and leisure spots
